<h1>My Koki My Baby</h1>
<p>
From the moment you entered my life everything became softer and brighter  
I love your smile your voice your laugh your kindness your eyes your tiny habits and the way you talk  
I love every little detail about you  
You are my comfort my peace and my favorite person in this entire world  
Even with the distance between us my heart has never felt closer to anyone the way it feels with you  
Every night I wish you were next to me and every morning you are the first thought in my head

<section>
<h1>I am Truly Sorry</h1>
<p>
Kenzi I need you to know how deeply sorry I am for every mistake I have ever made  
For every moment I upset you for every time I was careless or immature or not the man you deserved  
Sometimes I think about those moments and my heart hurts because the last person I ever want to hurt is you  
You gave me love and patience and I should have protected that better  
Please believe me when I say I am changing and learning and growing  
Not just saying words but actually trying every day to fix myself  
I want to be someone you feel safe with someone you trust completely someone who makes your life easier not harder  
I promise I am working on becoming that man for you
